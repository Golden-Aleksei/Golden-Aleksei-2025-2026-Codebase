# Notes
## Manual Tuning Notes by Julian (D4LM)
* No changes made to translational due to robot being to hard too push, I could only push a little bit before motors fought back
* No changes made to heading due to robot being super hard to rotate, I only could rotate a little bit before motors fought back
* No changes made to Drive due to it being OK, for 30 seconds, although it did drift, which according to troubleshooting is **normal**
* Centripetal looks fine to me (might be because I am tired...)
